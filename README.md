# ops-dc-terraform
Terraform is used to reflect the data center's desired state. This repository is a collection of terraform scripts that accomplishes this. These scripts are managed through automation. There are times where manual intervention may be needed to correct issues. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) has the scripts housed in the [ops-jet](https://github.com/CapstoneConsultingInc/ops-jet) repo manipulating the terraform scripts and executing the appropriate `terraform` commands. This separates the logic surrounding the management of resources from the state management. By keeping Terraform files focused on declarative resource management and minimizing embedded logic, you can maintain cleaner, more maintainable, and more predictable infrastructure code.
